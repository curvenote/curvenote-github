      File or folder to push to curvenote. PATH must be relative to the
      root directory of the GitHub repository.
    required: true
  project:

      Identifier of target Project. PROJECT may match title, name, or id
      of an existing Project. If no existing Project is found, a new
      Project will be created with title PROJECT.
    required: true
  article:
    description: |
      Identifier of target Article. ARTICLE may match title, name, or id
      of an existing Article. If no existing Article is found, a new
      Article will be created with title ARTICLE. ARTICLE is ignored if
      PATH is a folder. If PATH is a folder or ARTICLE is not provided,
      filename will be used for Article.
    required: false
  team:
    description: |
      Team to use when creating a new Project. TEAM is ignored if PROJECT
      already exists. If PROJECT does not exist and TEAM is not provided,
      the new Project will be created under the current user.
    required: false
  previous_commit: 
    description: |
      Commit hash when PATH was last pushed to curvenote. If PREVIOUS_COMMIT
      is provided, this will only push to curvenote if files under PATH
      have changed. If PREVIOUS_COMMIT is not provided, new Versions
      will be pushed to curvenote even if the source files have not
      changed. Note: this only works if repository is checked out with
      full git history in the workflow (i.e. "fetch-depth: 0").
